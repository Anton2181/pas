Debug-relax: OFF (W_HARD=1000000000000000000000)
Day rules:
  • AUTO present on (person,week,day) ⇒ need ≥2 tasks that day (Task Count weighted).
  • Same-day task exclusions respected; banned same-day pairs enforced (named days only).
  • Two named days in a week require at least one side to be fully manual.
Sibling rules:
  • Names-based pair groups (preferred-pair scoring).
  • Family-based groups per FAMILY TOKEN: at-most-one per person; banned sibling pairs respected.
Cooldown (prev-week, family-aggregated; applies only if ≥1 side AUTO):
  • PRIORITY: log-ladder soft W1 with base 3; streak W1_STREAK=25000000000000000.
  • NON-PRIORITY: log-ladder soft W2 with base 3; streak W2_STREAK=12500000000000000.
  • GAP penalties removed.
  • Gated pairs (AUTO present on prev or curr week): 601
  • Two-day soft (both AUTO) counted pairs: 184
Repeat limits (per person × family across horizon):
  • PRIORITY limit=1 (log-ladder soft at W1, base 2 above limit, gated on auto-PRI within family).
  • NON-PRIORITY limit=1 (log-ladder soft at W2, base 2 above limit, gated on auto-NON within family).
Tier-3 manual-only 1-task day discourage: W3=250000.
Tier-4 ‘Both’ fallback per-use: W4=10000000000000.
Tier-5 preferred-pair missed: W5=250.
Tier-6 across-horizon total-effort fairness (log-ladder): W6_OVER=2, W6_UNDER=5.
Tier-6 fairness mean: base=13, scaled=13, target(with delta)=13 (FAIR_MEAN_MULTIPLIER=1.0, FAIR_OVER_START_DELTA=0)
Priority coverage (GLOBAL): T1C=100000000 (TOP), T2C=5000000 (SECOND; ignored if TOP already).
